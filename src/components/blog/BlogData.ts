      <h3>Why Choose PVC Doors?</h3>
      <p>When it comes to selecting doors for <strong>bathrooms, toilets, and balconies</strong>, <strong>PVC doors</strong> are the best choice due to their <strong>waterproof, termite-proof, and long-lasting</strong> properties. Unlike wooden doors, PVC doors require <strong>minimal maintenance</strong> and are <strong>highly affordable</strong>, making them a great option for homeowners and businesses.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Features to Look for in a PVC Door</h3>
      <p>Before buying a PVC door, consider these important factors:</p>
      
      <h4>1️⃣ Water Resistance</h4>
      <p>PVC doors are <strong>100% waterproof</strong>, making them ideal for <strong>toilets and bathrooms</strong> where moisture exposure is high. Ensure that the door you choose has <strong>high-quality PVC sheets</strong> to prevent swelling or damage.</p>
      
      <h4>2️⃣ Durability & Strength</h4>
      <p>A high-quality PVC door should have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5mm thick PVC sheet on both sides</strong></li>
        <li><strong>0.15mm PVC decorative film for an attractive finish</strong></li>
        <li><strong>M.S. pipe framing inside to prevent bending</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Rigid PVC sheet inside for extra strength</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Z-on Door ensures all doors meet these standards for maximum durability.</p>

      <h4>4️⃣ Termite & Maintenance-Free</h4>
      <p>Unlike wood, <strong>PVC doors are termite-proof</strong> and <strong>do not require painting or polishing</strong>. Simply wipe them with a damp cloth for easy cleaning.</p>

    title: "The Advantage of PVC Embossed Doors Over Traditional Wooden Doors",
    excerpt: "Discover why PVC embossed doors are becoming the preferred choice for modern homes and businesses compared to traditional wooden doors.",
    content: `
      <p>In recent years, PVC embossed doors have gained significant popularity in both residential and commercial settings. Let's explore why these modern alternatives are often preferred over traditional wooden doors.</p>
      
      <h3>Durability and Longevity</h3>
      <p>Unlike wooden doors that can warp, rot, or get damaged by termites, PVC doors are highly resistant to environmental factors. They don't crack, peel, or fade easily, ensuring a longer lifespan with minimal maintenance.</p>
      
      <h3>Cost-Effective</h3>
      <p>While the initial investment might be comparable, PVC doors prove more economical in the long run due to their durability and low maintenance requirements.</p>
      
      <h3>Versatile Design Options</h3>
      <p>Z-ON DOOR offers a wide range of designs, colors, and textures, allowing customers to choose doors that match their interior décor perfectly.</p>
      
      <h3>Eco-Friendly Option</h3>
      <p>By choosing PVC doors, you're indirectly contributing to forest conservation as they reduce the demand for wood, making them an environmentally responsible choice.</p>
      
      <h3>Weather Resistance</h3>
      <p>PVC doors are excellent at withstanding harsh weather conditions. They don't absorb moisture, making them ideal for bathrooms, kitchens, and other areas exposed to humidity.</p>

      <h3>Consider Your Home's Architecture</h3>

    content: `
      <p>PVC embossed doors are known for their low maintenance requirements, but a little care can go a long way in preserving their beauty and extending their lifespan.</p>
      
      <h3>Regular Cleaning</h3>
      <p>Wipe the doors with a soft, damp cloth at least once a week to remove dust and prevent buildup. For more thorough cleaning, use mild soap and water solution.</p>
      
      <h3>Avoid Harsh Chemicals</h3>
      <p>Steer clear of abrasive cleaners, solvents, or bleach as they can damage the door's surface and affect its appearance.</p>
      
      <h3>Handle With Care</h3>
      <p>Avoid slamming the doors or hanging heavy items on them, as this can stress the hinges and potentially damage the door structure.</p>
      
      <h3>Address Issues Promptly</h3>
      <p>If you notice any loose hinges, squeaking, or other issues, address them promptly to prevent further damage.</p>
      
      <h3>Periodic Inspection</h3>
      <p>Regularly check for any signs of wear or damage, especially around the edges and hinges.</p>
